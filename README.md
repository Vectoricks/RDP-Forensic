A comprehensive PowerShell toolkit for analyzing and tracking Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections in Windows environments. This toolkit follows forensic best practices as documented in the Windows OS Hub RDP forensics guide.

## Overview

This toolkit provides detailed analysis of RDP connections across all connection stages:

1. **Network Connection** - Initial RDP connection attempts (EventID 1149)
2. **Authentication** - Successful and failed authentication (EventID 4624, 4625)
3. **Logon** - Session establishment (EventID 21, 22)
4. **Disconnect/Reconnect** - Session state changes (EventID 24, 25, 39, 40, 4778, 4779)
5. **Logoff** - Session termination (EventID 23, 4634, 4647, 9009)

## Scripts

### Get-RDPForensics.ps1

The main forensics analysis script that collects and analyzes RDP connection logs from multiple Windows Event Log sources.

**Features:**
- Collects events from Security, TerminalServices, and System logs
- Filters by date range, username, or source IP
- Exports results to CSV format
- Generates summary reports
- Supports outbound RDP connection tracking

**Requirements:**
- Windows Server 2012 R2 or later / Windows 8.1 or later
- Administrator privileges (required to read Security event logs)
- PowerShell 5.1 or later

**Usage Examples:**

```powershell
# Get all RDP events for today
.\Get-RDPForensics.ps1

# Get last 7 days of RDP events
.\Get-RDPForensics.ps1 -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-7)

# Get RDP events for specific user
.\Get-RDPForensics.ps1 -Username "john.doe" -StartDate (Get-Date).AddMonths(-1)

# Filter by source IP address
.\Get-RDPForensics.ps1 -SourceIP "192.168.1.100"

# Export results to CSV
.\Get-RDPForensics.ps1 -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-30) -ExportPath "C:\Reports\RDP"

# Include outbound RDP connections
.\Get-RDPForensics.ps1 -IncludeOutbound

# Get events for last month with export
.\Get-RDPForensics.ps1 -StartDate (Get-Date).AddMonths(-1) -ExportPath "C:\RDP_Analysis" -IncludeOutbound
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `StartDate` | DateTime | Start date for log collection | Beginning of current day |
| `EndDate` | DateTime | End date for log collection | Current time |
| `ExportPath` | String | Path to export CSV files | None (display only) |
| `Username` | String | Filter by specific username | None |
| `SourceIP` | String | Filter by source IP address | None |
| `IncludeOutbound` | Switch | Include outbound RDP connections | False |

### Get-CurrentRDPSessions.ps1

Quick analysis script for viewing currently active RDP sessions.

**Features:**
- Shows active RDP sessions with user information
- Displays session states (Active/Disconnected)
- Lists running processes per session
- Shows recent logon information for active users

**Usage Examples:**

```powershell
# Display all current sessions
.\Get-CurrentRDPSessions.ps1

# Show processes for all sessions
.\Get-CurrentRDPSessions.ps1 -ShowProcesses

# Get detailed info for specific session
.\Get-CurrentRDPSessions.ps1 -SessionID 3 -ShowProcesses
```

## Event IDs Reference

### Connection Attempts
- **1149** - Remote Desktop Services: User authentication succeeded (RemoteConnectionManager)

### Authentication
- **4624** - An account was successfully logged on
- **4625** - An account failed to log on

### Session Events (TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager)
- **21** - Session logon succeeded
- **22** - Shell start notification received
- **23** - Session logoff succeeded
- **24** - Session has been disconnected
- **25** - Session reconnection succeeded
- **39** - Session disconnected by another session
- **40** - Session disconnected with reason code

### Reconnect/Disconnect (Security Log)
- **4778** - Session reconnected to Window Station
- **4779** - Session disconnected from Window Station

### Logoff
- **4634** - An account was logged off
- **4647** - User-initiated logoff
- **9009** - Desktop Window Manager has exited

### Outbound Connections
- **1102** - RDP client connection initiated (TerminalServices-RDPClient)

## Logon Types

The scripts filter and report on the following RDP-related logon types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 10 | RemoteInteractive (standard RDP connection) |
| 7 | Unlock or reconnect to existing session |
| 3 | Network logon (can include RDP) |
| 5 | Service or console connection (/admin mode) |

## Event Log Locations

The scripts query the following event logs:

1. **Security** (`Security`)
   - Authentication and logon/logoff events
   - Session reconnect/disconnect events

2. **TerminalServices-RemoteConnectionManager** (`Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RemoteConnectionManager/Operational`)
   - Connection attempts and authentication

3. **TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager** (`Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager/Operational`)
   - Session lifecycle events

4. **TerminalServices-RDPClient** (`Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RDPClient/Operational`)
   - Outbound RDP connections

5. **System** (`System`)
   - DWM exit events indicating session termination

## Output Format

### CSV Export

When using the `-ExportPath` parameter, two files are generated:

1. **RDP_Forensics_TIMESTAMP.csv** - Detailed event log with columns:
   - TimeCreated
   - EventID
   - EventType
   - User
   - Domain
   - SourceIP
   - SessionID
   - LogonID
   - Details

2. **RDP_Summary_TIMESTAMP.txt** - Summary report containing:
   - Analysis period
   - Total event count
   - Events grouped by type
   - Unique users
   - Unique source IPs

## Common Use Cases

### Incident Response
```powershell
# Investigate suspicious activity from specific IP
.\Get-RDPForensics.ps1 -SourceIP "203.0.113.50" -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-7) -ExportPath "C:\IR\RDP"
```

### Compliance Auditing
```powershell
# Monthly RDP access audit
.\Get-RDPForensics.ps1 -StartDate (Get-Date).AddMonths(-1) -ExportPath "C:\Compliance\RDP_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM')"
```

### User Activity Tracking
```powershell
# Track specific user's RDP sessions
.\Get-RDPForensics.ps1 -Username "admin" -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-30) -ExportPath "C:\UserActivity"
```

### Real-time Monitoring
```powershell
# Check current sessions
.\Get-CurrentRDPSessions.ps1 -ShowProcesses
```

### Failed Logon Analysis (Brute Force Detection)
```powershell
# Export events and filter for failed attempts
$events = .\Get-RDPForensics.ps1 -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-1)
$events | Where-Object { $_.EventID -eq 4625 } | Group-Object SourceIP | Sort-Object Count -Descending
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Events Returned

1. **Check Administrator Rights**: Ensure you're running as Administrator
   ```powershell
   # Verify admin rights
   ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal][Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)
   ```

2. **Verify Event Logs Exist**: Ensure the required logs are enabled
   ```powershell
   Get-WinEvent -ListLog *TerminalServices* | Select-Object LogName, IsEnabled, RecordCount
   ```

3. **Check Date Range**: Events may be outside your specified date range or logs may have rotated

4. **Increase Log Size**: If logs are rotating too quickly, increase the maximum log size
   ```powershell
   wevtutil sl Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager/Operational /ms:104857600
   ```

### Parsing Errors

If you encounter regex parsing issues (Username showing as "-\-"), ensure you're using the latest version of the script which includes updated regex patterns.

### Performance Considerations

For large environments with extensive logs:
- Use specific date ranges to limit query scope
- Filter by username or IP to reduce result sets
- Consider scheduled exports rather than real-time queries
- Increase available memory for PowerShell if processing large result sets

## Security Best Practices

1. **Protect exported logs**: Store forensic data in secure locations with restricted access
2. **Regular monitoring**: Schedule regular analysis to detect anomalies early
3. **Log retention**: Ensure adequate log retention policies (30-90 days minimum)
4. **Baseline establishment**: Create baselines of normal RDP activity for comparison
5. **Alert on anomalies**: Set up alerts for:
   - Multiple failed logons from same IP
   - Logons from unusual geographic locations
   - After-hours administrative access
   - Unusual session durations
