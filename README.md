   - TimeCreated
   - EventID
   - EventType
   - User
   - Domain
   - SourceIP
   - SessionID

## Common Use Cases

### Incident Response
```powershell
# Investigate suspicious activity from specific IP
.\Get-RDPForensics.ps1 -SourceIP "203.0.113.50" -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-7) -ExportPath "C:\IR\RDP"
```

### Compliance Auditing
```powershell
# Monthly RDP access audit
.\Get-RDPForensics.ps1 -StartDate (Get-Date).AddMonths(-1) -ExportPath "C:\Compliance\RDP_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM')"
```

### User Activity Tracking
```powershell
# Track specific user's RDP sessions
.\Get-RDPForensics.ps1 -Username "admin" -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-30) -ExportPath "C:\UserActivity"
```

### Real-time Monitoring
```powershell
# Check current sessions
.\Get-CurrentRDPSessions.ps1 -ShowProcesses
```

### Failed Logon Analysis (Brute Force Detection)
```powershell
# Export events and filter for failed attempts
$events = .\Get-RDPForensics.ps1 -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-1)
$events | Where-Object { $_.EventID -eq 4625 } | Group-Object SourceIP | Sort-Object Count -Descending
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Events Returned

1. **Check Administrator Rights**: Ensure you're running as Administrator
   ```powershell
   # Verify admin rights
   ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal][Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)
   ```

2. **Verify Event Logs Exist**: Ensure the required logs are enabled
   ```powershell
   Get-WinEvent -ListLog *TerminalServices* | Select-Object LogName, IsEnabled, RecordCount
   ```

3. **Check Date Range**: Events may be outside your specified date range or logs may have rotated

4. **Increase Log Size**: If logs are rotating too quickly, increase the maximum log size
   ```powershell
   wevtutil sl Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager/Operational /ms:104857600
   ```

### Parsing Errors

If you encounter regex parsing issues (Username showing as "-\-"), ensure you're using the latest version of the script which includes updated regex patterns.

### Performance Considerations

For large environments with extensive logs:
- Use specific date ranges to limit query scope
- Filter by username or IP to reduce result sets
- Consider scheduled exports rather than real-time queries
- Increase available memory for PowerShell if processing large result sets

## Security Best Practices

1. **Protect exported logs**: Store forensic data in secure locations with restricted access
2. **Regular monitoring**: Schedule regular analysis to detect anomalies early
3. **Log retention**: Ensure adequate log retention policies (30-90 days minimum)
4. **Baseline establishment**: Create baselines of normal RDP activity for comparison
5. **Alert on anomalies**: Set up alerts for:
   - Multiple failed logons from same IP
   - Logons from unusual geographic locations
   - After-hours administrative access
   - Unusual session durations
